# Weather-App
I have used HTML5 to create a clean structure for the input field and display sections. 

CSS3 was applied to design a visually appealing layout with responsive design features, using Flexbox and media queries to ensure compatibility across devices. 

JavaScript powered the core functionality by capturing user input (city name), sending requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, and displaying real-time data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app updates dynamically based on user input, demonstrating asynchronous programming and API integration.
